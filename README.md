# amazon-clone

A simple clone of amazon using reactjs. For deploying the model, I am using firebase, a free service by google. I implemented this with the help of following [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1_IYL9ZMR_Y&t=4433s).

Things I learnt while implementing this project.
  - Functional based component and react hooks
  - Context API and Redux
  - Difference between linking page using href and Link : Unlike href, Link switch between pages without reloading
