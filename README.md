# amazon-clone

A simple clone of amazon using reactjs. For deploying the model, I am using firebase, a free service by google. I implemented this with the help of following [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1_IYL9ZMR_Y&t=4433s).

### Things I learnt while implementing this project.
  - Difference between linking page using href and Link : Unlike href, Link switch between pages without reloading
  - Functional based component and react hooks
  - Context API
  - User Authentification using firebase
  - Deploying the project using firebase

### Things that I can be improved
  - A Product Page that can be used to display the product
  - Individual basket for each user 
  - Payment options, etc.
  
And Yeah I had also not changed the title ðŸ˜…
